# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.
Evaluate whether the text contains any  of the following behaviours and if so, give their counts below:
- sub goal setting behavior, where the writer breaks down the problem into smaller, intermediate goals.
- Rule following - does the model follow the rules of the taxonomy
- Error breakdown - could the model recognize individual errors

The fules of the taxonomy are as follows:
'substitution' is when the child substitutes one word/phrase/syllable for another. 
'omission' is when the child omits one word/phrase/syllable. 
'addition' is when the child adds one word/phrase/syllable. 
'typically_developing' is when the child's speech is typical of a child of their age. 
'stuttering' is when the child stutters, has difficulty speaking, repeats sounds/words or prolongs sounds/words

With this context, please do the following:
1. Count the number of distinct subgoal setting instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the writer does not set sub goals, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.
2. Determine wether the text showcases rule following and provide the bool between the tags <rule_bool> </rule_bool>
3. Determine wether the text showcases error recognition and provide the bool between the tags <error_bool> </error_bool>

# Output Format
Format your response in markdown as follows:

## Thoughts
[Brief description describing what behavior was noticed and where backtracking occurred]

## Does subgoal setting?
[yes/no]

## Number of subgoal setting steps
<count> [1/2/...] </count>

## Follows rules
<rule_bool> [0/1] </rule_bool>

## Recognizes erros
<error_bool> [0/1] </error_bool>
